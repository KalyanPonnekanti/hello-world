# hello-world
Learning project
I work as a Technical Publication Manager with Synopsys, Inc. mostly writing and managing a team of writers. I work in the Processor Group, focusing on processor documentation, software documentation, API documentation, and development toolchain documentation (compilers, debuggers, IDEs).

This blog focusses primarily on the following:

   * Troubleshooting day-to-day tool-related problems, opportunities, and innovation that my team and I face when doing our work.
   * Working with different sources: ReST, DITA, unstructured FrameMaker, RTF, Doxygen
   * Authoring in DITA using FrameMaker
   * Converting unstructured content to DITA
   * Lifelong learning
   
All the content on this blog has been compiled based on our own research and from various online resources. The views on this blog are my own and not of my employer. 

This blog is intended as a knowledge base and record keeping of the hours of research to fix day-to-day problems.
